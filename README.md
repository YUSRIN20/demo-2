This repository is created for giving Demo on Git & Git Hub.


Things I did for making this repository.

+ Created a empty repository `Demo-2` in [GitHub](https://github.com/new).
+ Copied the contents from the page 
```
echo "# demo-2" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YUSRIN20/demo-2.git
git push -u origin main 
         
```
+ I have created an empty folder in my file explorer and operand the folder in CMD.After operand the CMD
I just copy pasted and executed the lines one by one   
   + This First line `echo "#Demo-2" >> README.md` created an README.md file with the content `"# Demo-2".
